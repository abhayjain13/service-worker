# Service Worker
A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction.

# How to use
1. Clone the Repository
2. Run the index.html using Live Server
3. Open Development tools, Open Application > Service Worker 
4. Check the status is running.

# About Repository
It's a basic setup of service worker in a project, what's can be improved? We can also integrate Push Notification and Background sync in this project. I will updating this code soon..
